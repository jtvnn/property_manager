# Property Manager Icon

This is a placeholder icon file. For production, you should replace this with proper icon files:

- icon.png (512x512 for Linux)
- icon.ico (for Windows)
- icon.icns (for macOS)

You can create these using tools like:
- Online: https://www.icoconvert.com/
- Desktop: GIMP, Photoshop, or Sketch
- CLI: ImageMagick

The icon should represent your property management brand and be recognizable at small sizes.
